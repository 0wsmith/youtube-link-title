# YouTube Link Title

This script is not being maintained anymore.
Feel free to fork (but change the YouTube API key).



# What it does
* If link text doesn't contain a URL, the video title will be added as tooltip instead.
* A crossed out link indicates that the video is unavailable.
* Move cursor over links to see preview images.
* URLs are rewritten to clean HTTPS addresses.

# If you left-click a video link, the video gets embedded and started.
* Time offsets like "t=3m21s" are preserved.
* You can still follow links normally by middle click, Ctrl + click etc.
* Some uploaders don't want their videos to be embedded. These videos will open in a new tab.
* Embed modes:
1. inline (link gets replaced with video)
2. draggable, non-scrolling in-page popup (default)
3. freely resizable popup window (doesn't close when you leave the page)

# Also:
* Support for Vimeo, LiveLeak, Dailymotion, vidme, WorldStarHipHop, Vine, Coub and Streamable
* Titles are cached to reduce traffic and delay on subsequent visits.
* To change settings: Monkey toolbar icon → "User Script Commands" → "Set up YouTube Link Title..."
